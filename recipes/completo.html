    <h2>COMPLETO ITALIANO (CHILEAN ITALIAN-STYLE HOT DOG)</h2>
    <p>
        Looking for a fantastic way to serve hot dogs this summer? Chile has that covered. Literally!
        Hot dogs were introduced to Chile in the 1920s and the toppings have been adapted to create a mash-up of fun and delicious flavors.
        There are a variety of combinations available, many with specific names. I was immediately drawn to the Completo Italiano.
    </p>
    <p>    
        This version is called Italiano since the toppings together resemble the colors (green, white, red) of the Italian flag.
        Hot dogs (Vienesas) are boiled in water until heated through, then arranged in toasted buns with diced tomatoes, mashed avocado (Palta), and mayonnaise.
        Serve immediately with ketchup and/or mustard if desired.
